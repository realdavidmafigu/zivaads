## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the SQL schema to create the required tables:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
\i ai_performance_reports_schema.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
# OpenAI API Key for AI analysis
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Cron job secret (optional but recommended)
CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret_key

# WhatsApp configuration (if using WhatsApp alerts)
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_whatsapp_phone_number_id
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_whatsapp_access_token
```

### 3. Cron Job Setup

Set up automatic cron jobs to generate reports at scheduled times:

#### Option A: Using a Cron Service (Recommended)

Use a service like [Cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) or [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com):

**Morning Reports (8 AM):**
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/api/cron/ai-performance-reports?type=morning
Method: POST
Headers: Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret
Schedule: 0 8 * * *
```

**Afternoon Reports (2 PM):**
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/api/cron/ai-performance-reports?type=afternoon
Method: POST
Headers: Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret
Schedule: 0 14 * * *
```

**Evening Reports (8 PM):**
```
URL: https://your-domain.com/api/cron/ai-performance-reports?type=evening
Method: POST
Headers: Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret
Schedule: 0 20 * * *
```

#### Option B: Server Cron (Linux/Unix)

Add to your server's crontab:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add these lines
0 8 * * * curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/ai-performance-reports?type=morning
0 14 * * * curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/ai-performance-reports?type=afternoon
0 20 * * * curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret" https://your-domain.com/api/cron/ai-performance-reports?type=evening
```
