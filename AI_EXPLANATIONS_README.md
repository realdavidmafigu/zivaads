## 🚀 Key Features

- **Plain English**: "2 out of 100 people clicked your ad - this is excellent!"

#### CPM (Cost Per Mille)
- **Technical**: "$15.00 CPM"
- **Plain English**: "It costs you $0.15 to reach 1,000 people - this is reasonable for your market."

#### CPC (Cost Per Click)
- **Technical**: "$0.50 CPC"
- **Plain English**: "Each click costs you $0.50 - this is a fair price for website visitors."

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { convertToSimpleLanguage } from '@/lib/ai-explanations';
import PerformanceExplainer from '@/components/PerformanceExplainer';
import AIInsights from '@/components/AIInsights';

const metrics = {
  ctr: 2.5,
  cpm: 15.0,
  cpc: 0.60,
  impressions: 10000,
  clicks: 250,
  spend: 150,
  reach: 9000,
  frequency: 1.1
};

// Get all explanations
const explanations = convertToSimpleLanguage(metrics);

// Use components
<PerformanceExplainer metrics={metrics} />
<AIInsights metrics={metrics} />
```

### Individual Functions

```tsx
import { 
  explainCTR, 
  explainCPM, 
  explainCPC, 
  performanceGrade,
  customerCostExplainer 
} from '@/lib/ai-explanations';

// Explain individual metrics
const ctrExplanation = explainCTR(2.5);
const cpmExplanation = explainCPM(15.0);
const grade = performanceGrade(metrics);
const customerCost = customerCostExplainer(250, 150);
```

## 🌍 Zimbabwe-Specific Features

The system includes local context for the Zimbabwean market:

- **Internet cost awareness**: Emphasizes cost optimization due to high internet costs
- **Mobile-first approach**: Recommendations consider mobile usage patterns
- **Peak hours**: Suggests optimal timing for ad campaigns
- **Cultural relevance**: Encourages local language and cultural references
- **Budget considerations**: Conservative approach to scaling campaigns

## 🎯 Common Explanations

### High CPM
> "Your ads are expensive to show. In Zimbabwe, where internet costs are high, this is especially important to optimize."

### Low CTR
> "People aren't interested in clicking. Zimbabwean users are very selective about clicking ads, so your ad needs to be compelling."

### High Frequency
> "People are seeing your ad too much. This can lead to ad fatigue and wasted money."

### Good Performance
> "Your campaign is performing well! This is great for the Zimbabwean market where competition is growing!"

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Visit the Demo**: Navigate to `/dashboard/ai-demo` to see the system in action
2. **Try Different Scenarios**: Use the scenario selector to see how different metrics are explained
3. **Integrate into Campaigns**: The system is already integrated into the campaign details page
4. **Customize Explanations**: Modify the functions in `ai-explanations.ts` to adjust thresholds and language

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjusting Thresholds

Modify the threshold values in `ai-explanations.ts`:

```tsx
// Example: Make CTR requirements more lenient
if (ctr >= 2.0) {  // Changed from 3.0
  return { sentiment: 'good', emoji: '😊', color: 'green' };
}
```

### Adding New Metrics

Extend the `PerformanceMetrics` interface and add new explanation functions:

```tsx
export interface PerformanceMetrics {
  // ... existing metrics
  conversionRate: number;
}

export function explainConversionRate(rate: number): ExplanationResult {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Localizing for Other Markets

Create market-specific context functions:

```tsx
function getMarketContext(insight: AIInsight, market: string): string {
  switch (market) {
    case 'zimbabwe':
      return getZimbabweContext(insight);
    case 'nigeria':
      return getNigeriaContext(insight);
    // ... other markets
  }
}
```
