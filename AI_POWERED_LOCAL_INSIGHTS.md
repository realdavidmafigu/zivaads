# AI-Only Local Insights

## Overview

The Local Insights feature now uses **AI-only analysis** that combines your campaign performance data with Zimbabwean local context to provide intelligent, actionable insights. **No fallback to rule-based insights** - the system is designed to provide the highest quality, most personalized insights possible.

## How It Works

### AI Analysis Process

The system:

1. **Collects Campaign Data**: Fetches your current campaign performance metrics
2. **Analyzes Local Context**: Considers Zimbabwean factors like:
   - Power outages (ZESA load shedding schedules)
   - Economic cycles (month-end spending, month-start recovery)
   - Social behavior patterns (evening peak usage, weekend shopping)
   - Mobile-first usage patterns
   - Local cultural preferences

3. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to:
   - Analyze your specific campaign performance
   - Combine it with local Zimbabwean context
   - Generate personalized, actionable insights

4. **Error Handling**: If AI is unavailable, returns a clear error message instead of fallback insights

## Features

### Smart Context Awareness

The AI analyzes your campaigns in the context of:

- **Time-based factors**: Current hour, day of week, month-end/start
- **Power infrastructure**: ZESA load shedding impact on internet usage
- **Economic patterns**: Salary cycles and spending behavior
- **Social behavior**: Peak usage times and cultural patterns
- **Mobile usage**: Zimbabwe's mobile-first internet access

### Personalized Recommendations

Instead of generic advice, you get insights like:

- "Your campaign CTR is 2.1% during evening peak hours (6-10 PM), which is good for Zimbabwean standards. Consider increasing budget during these hours."
- "Month-end spending is active, but your CPC has increased 15%. This suggests higher competition - consider adjusting your bidding strategy."
- "Power outages during 6-10 AM are affecting your morning campaign performance. Consider pausing ads during these hours."

### Intelligent Priority System

Insights are automatically prioritized based on:
- **High Priority**: Critical issues requiring immediate action
- **Medium Priority**: Optimization opportunities
- **Low Priority**: General best practices and observations
